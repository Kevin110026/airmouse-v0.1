this is the next version of the airmouse v0.0
"supposed" to be more accurate and handy

...

don't blame me if I mess it up instead...

pls install first using `pip install -r req.txt`

how to use:
    after the camera is activated, move your hand into the camera
    curve your thumb to start controlling mouse by hand
    curve all fingers to quit controlling(looks like cat's paws)
    the system quit controlling automatically once it doesn't detect any hand with camera

    mouse moving -> thumb:
        Mouse will be dragged by your hand as long as you keep the thumb curved
    mouse left click -> forefinger:
        Curve it to hold and uncurve it to release
        Curve then uncurve it fast to click, just like common mouse
    mouse right click -> middle finger:
        Curve it to hold and uncurve it to release
        Curve then uncurve it fast to click, just like common mouse, idk why do you need double right click anyway
    mouse scrolling -> ring finger:
        Curve it then move your hand to scroll.
        The mouse can't be dragged while scrolling
    mouse slow moving mode -> little finger:
        Curve it to make dragging/scrolling slow down.
        You still have to curve the thumb or ring finger to drag/scroll while in slow moving mode
    mouse left double click -> forefinger( & middle finger):
        Original method: This can be done by left clicking twice fast.
        Another method: Curve forefinger first then curve middle finger to double click.
        This additional rule is designed to make you still be able to double click with low fps, which is hard to be done by the original method
