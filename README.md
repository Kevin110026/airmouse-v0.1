When *Searching* window pops, move your hand into the area that camera can capture.

Then, curve the thumb of the hand you want to use to make system recognize.

After that, *Matching* window should pop up, meaning that it has found your curving hand.

While Matching, hold your thumb still and move your hand a bit to make system get your hand's position more precisely. This step won't take too long.

After the system get your hand position, *Controlling* window will pop up, meaning that you can start controlling the cursor by your hand!


curve all fingers to quit *Controlling* mode and back to *Searching*(looks like a cat's paw)

the system will also quit *Controlling* mode automatically when the camera can't detect any hand within it's range.

Original method: This can be done by left clicking twice fast.

Another method: Curve forefinger first then curve middle finger to double click.
        
`This additional rule is designed to make you still be able to double click under low fps, which is hard to be done by the original method`
## mouse right click
**middle finger:**

Curve it to hold and uncurve it to release

Curve then uncurve it fast to click, just like common mouse, idk why do you need double right click anyway

# Common Issues:

## camera

`Exception: Unable to access camera, please check README.md for more info`
